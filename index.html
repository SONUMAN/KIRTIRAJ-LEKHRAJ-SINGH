Chaos is the Mother of All Destruction,
Destroy is the Mother of All Acquaintances,
So, Acquaintance is a Apprentice to Father Time"
                                                             _ Kirtiraj Lekhraj Singh</p>

<p>I m a Sensitive person if some one try me
Not so speak directly but indirectly i say so much that they have to understand me is as that simple like SIGN.. Maybe Late, I will GET IT.
Always people says before speak think Ten Times.And I Say I Had No Ten Head to think like you..But I Use Ten Percent As Best As I Can!</p>

Apologies, To Those Who Doesn't Understand Me
For Them I Love Being Simple Person Guy.. </p>

<p>Truth Above me: Once Childhood I was Married (Indirectly) 
to a Plant "Tulsi" Called Ocimum tenuiflorum Plant.
 Marring Once I didn't want to wish to Marry Again 
as I never want to Marry Again:
As Someone Say:Once We Lived,Once We Die,
Once We Do Matrimony, And Once We Fallen In Love Forever,
Like A Human Universal Truth.</p>
